The ardrone has a parameter that set's the accepted mac address of the host compputer, the "owner_mac" parameter.

When this parameter is set, the owner computer is the only one that can connect with the drone via WiFi (other computers will not be able to stablish a connection with the ardrone. This is convenient for the competition.

In order to set this parameter from a computer, it can be done using the ardrone_autonomy package adding the following line to the launchfile:
	<param name="owner_mac" value="XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX" /> 
	For an example, see the launchfile: ${IMAV_STACK}/launch_dir/ardrone_launchfiles/ardrone_indoors_maclock.launch

Once the parameter is set, only the computer with the specified mac address can access the drone.

Surprisingly the configuration cannot be undone changing that line to:
	<param name="owner_mac" value="00:00:00:00:00:00" />
	For some reason the required AT command will not be sent.

To unconfigure the owner_mac parameter the ardrone has to be reseted (the button is located below the battery location, "reset" sign). Once the ardrone is reseted it will come back to the default configuration (including wifi ssid and owner mac address).

Note that the parameters of the ardrone can be double checked doing the following:
$ telnet 192.168.1.1
$ cat data/config.ini
or
$ vi data/config.ini
