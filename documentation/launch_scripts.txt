In order to run an autonomous mission with the Ardrone using the Aerosstack, the following scripts are provided (please take a look at them to understand how to modify them for your own purposes):

- `${DRONE_STACK}/launchers/Noche_de_los_investigadores/quadrotor_laNocheInvestigadores_simulator.sh` : for simulated flights.

- `${DRONE_STACK}/launchers/Noche_de_los_investigadores/quadrotor_laNocheInvestigadores.sh` : for experimental flights.

- `${DRONE_STACK}/launchers/Noche_de_los_investigadores/rvizInterface_Test.sh` : for visualizing on RVIZ 


In order to run the stack, it was decided to run each node in a separate tab of a terminal window. The initialization of the architecture is done by executing shell scripts that open a new terminal with each node running in its tab. 

The launch scripts have to be called using the following sintax in the shell terminal: 

```bash
$ cd ${DRONE_STACK}/launchers/Noche_de_los_investigadores
$ quadrotor_laNocheInvestigadores.sh  NUMID_DRONE NETWORK_ROSCORE DRONE_IP DRONE_WIFI_CHANNEL
$ # example
$ quadrotor_laNocheInvestigadores.sh 1 ROS_10 '' 11
```
- The configuration files (mission, known ArUco markers locations, controller configuration, etc) are located in `${DRONE_STACK}/configs/drone${NUMID\_DRONE}/` . Many of the Aerostack nodes access these files in order to read their configuration parameters.

NOTE: all the launchfiles open a separate terminal with multiple tabs, where each tab usually runs only one tab. If you close the terminal tabs using the close button at the corner of the window which has multiple tabs, then only one of the tabs will be closed correctly (the one that is currently selected):

- The easiest way to do this fast, and cleanly is to: first, press `control+c` on every tab (navigating with `control+repag` and `control+avpag`), second, use the shortcut `ctrl+shift+w` to close first all terminal tabs and, third, `ctrl+shift+q` to close the las terminal tab (which closes the window too) including all tabs. 

- The following script might be used to send a SIG\_TERM to all the terminals (equivalent to pressing `control+c` in them): ${DRONE_STACK}/launchers/stop.sh.
