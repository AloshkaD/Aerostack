TODO in the stack

0. Testing

1. Allow linkage of modules in execution time and not in compiling time -> It is easy, but time consuming (some modules already ok, so copy-paste). It is a very big weakness of the stack now, because it is not fully functional yet! :_(

2. Cleaning is needed! -> There is a lot of shit and old things!

3. Documentation improvement! -> A must!

4. Change names of libs and executables to use the standard ${PROJECT_NAME} + something -> Additionally change launchers and sh... It is a standard! We were doing wrong and the standard makes sense (I had to change the name of some, because it didn't compile :S)!

5. Improve configs -> not all the modules are ok :_(

6. Improve droneMsgsROS -> delete old and improve new with Header

7. Improve droneModuleROS -> improve functionality and create py droneModule to give python projects full functionallity.

8. Change the name of the packages to adapt to ROS specs -> warnings when compiling! Not standard yet :_(!

9. Divide some packages, like lib_cvgutils that is a huge package used by a lot of modules -> this is a shit!

10. Fix dependencies -> I already tried to fix it, but still need to view reviewed!
