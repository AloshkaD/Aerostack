First: checkout the related ROS tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/NetworkSetup .

Then, follow these steps:

1. Configure a LAN network connection to communicate this ground stations with the rest using ROS. The configuration that we have used during testing is shown in the image (in this folder): `${DRONE_STACK}/documentation/network_configuration/ROS_NETWORK_config.png` (from now called ROS_NETWORK).

2. Edit the hosts file, all the computers in the network have to be included in it. The IPs have to be the same that is specified in the configuration of each computer's ROS_NETWORK configuration.

	- to edit the hosts file, run: sudo gedit /etc/hosts
	- an example of it is shown in the file (in this folder): `${DRONE_STACK}/documentation/network_configuration/hosts`

3. Restart your network for the configuration changes to take place.
