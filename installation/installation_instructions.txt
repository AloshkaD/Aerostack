DEINSTALL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES OF OTHER (OLDER) VERSIONS OF THE STACK
sed -i '/DRONE_WORKSPACE/d' ~/.bashrc
sed -i '/DRONE_STACK/d' ~/.bashrc




NAVIGATE TO WORKSPACE OF ROS (OR CREATE IT)
#example
cd ~/workspace/ros

CREATE A FOLDER FOR THE WHOLE STACK APPLICATION
mkdir quadrotor_stack_catkin
cd quadrotor_stack_catkin

CREATION OF THE CATKING WORKSPACE and first built
source /opt/ros/jade/setup.bash
mkdir src
cd src
catkin_init_workspace
cd ..
catkin_make


SOURCERING THE STACK
source devel/setup.bash


DOWNLOAD STACK
#choose branch. By default master!
git clone -b master https://bitbucket.org/joselusl/quadrotor_swarm_sub.git ./src/quadrotor_stack



INSTALL THE WORKSPACE -> for the setup.sh
./src/quadrotor_stack/installation/installers/installWS.sh



INSTALL THE STACK -> for the launchers and the logs
cd src/quadrotor_stack
./installation/installers/installStack.sh


#close terminal and reopen it, or alternatively execute
source ~/.bashrc




DOWNLOAD REQUIRED PACKAGES OF THE STACK -> This step is slow, so, be patient!
cd $DRONE_STACK
#set to true packages required in installation/configSubmodules.cfg
#if the packages are not already defined in the stack run script to add submodules
./installation/gitSubmoduleAdd.sh installation/configSubmodules.cfg
#if the packages are already defined in the stack run script to init submodules
./installation/gitSubmoduleUpdateInit.sh installation/configSubmodules.cfg





COMPILE STACK
cd $DRONE_STACK
source setup.sh
cd $DRONE_WORKSPACE
catkin_make




OPENING STACK with qtcreator
cd $DRONE_WORKSPACE/src
rm CMakeLists.txt
cp /opt/ros/jade/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake CMakeLists.txt
cd ..
source devel/setup.bash
qtcreator
#put the build folder in the correct path!


# REQUIRED LIBRARIES FOR HUMAN MACHINE INTERFACE

# Run the following command to download and install the necessary dependencies
    $ sudo apt-get build-dep openscenegraph

# Download OpenSceneGraph 3.2.2, extract the files and store the folder OpenSceneGraph-3.2.2 in your home path
http://trac.openscenegraph.org/downloads/developer_releases/OpenSceneGraph-3.2.2.zip

# Installation OpenSceneGraph 3.2.2. Please be patient in this step, it could take up a lot of time
    $ cd ~/OpenSceneGraph-3.2.2
    $ ./configure
    $ make      
    $ sudo make install

# Configure the enviromental variables. 

Edit your ~/.bashrc file, add the following lines in it (at the end). 
Keep in mind, to change /home/myaccount to your real home path (cd ~ && pwd).
    export PATH=${PATH}:/home/myaccount/OpenSceneGraph-3.2.2/bin
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/home/myaccount/OpenSceneGraph-3.2.2/lib

# Download human_machine_interface
